#This is the other half of the answer

#Print the joke setup and punchline
print x
print y

#Repeat it, using %r (which will print it in string format w/ '' on either side) and using %s (which you manually have to put the '' on)
print "I said %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y

#Make sure people know the joke isn't funny

#Ask if the joke is evaluated

#OK, so instead of being print 'Isn't that funny %r' % (hilarious), this puts the %r in the joke_evaluation variable itself and allows you to print in this way: variable % variable
print joke_evaluation % hilarious
