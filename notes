Notes (-) & Questions (*)

Ex0
* Once I'm in the PythonTHW folder, I don't know how to get out of it, either to the parent directory or another folder.

Ex3
- Python always rounds down, no matter how high the decimal is, unless you put a decimal after one of the inputs (e.g. 5/2 = 2, but 5.0/2 = 2.5 and 5/2.00 = 2.500)

Ex4
- You can print by doing print "String goes here", variable_name instead of using a % method or .format()

Ex5
- %s = print a string
- %d = print integer
- %r = print raw, will print out with ''

Ex7
- You can print multiple variables together by doing print variable_1 + variable_2 + variable_3 or by doing print variable_4, print variable_5

Ex13
- Using int() on the command line doesn't work, have to put it in the file where you define = argv (or in the print command)

Ex15
- Ctrl + K will comment out a block of highlighted code in Notepad++ (Alt + 3 in IDLE)
- Ctrl Q will uncomment a block of highlighted code in Notepad++ (Alt + 4 in IDLE)
- Use file_name.close() to close files at the end of functions like this. It's very important.

Ex16
- Use .read() to print out the contents of a file (that you've stored in a variable)

Ex17
* Need to read up more on import and what modules you can import

Ex21
- In a function, you can 'return' anything you can put to the right of a '='

Ex22
* still stuck on the following:
	- from sys import argv
	- importing things in general, where am i importing things from, exactly?
	- opening files, writing to them, and closing them

Ex 24
- You can define new variables by calling a function as long as the function returns the same number of items as variables you are trying to define, e.g. var_1, var_2, var_3 = defined_function(100) as long as defined_function returns 3 things.

Ex 25
- To run Python in the PowerShell like IDLE, just type "python"
-- If you're doing this make sure to import the file you want to run
- To stop running Python in the PowerShell, type "exit()". You have to exit and reopen python and reimport the file if you've made any changes
